            “Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social <br>
            well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” <br>
            In 1986, the WHO made further clarifications: “A resource for <br>
            everyday life, not the objective of living.Having a healthy body <br>
            and mind is very important for overall well-being. Having a bad <br>
            lifestyle would result in poor mental health. Adapting a healthy <br>
            lifestyle would relax the mind and improve the mood. Only when a <br>
            person is happy mentally, they would perform productively.Good <br>
            health is not just the absence of disease or illness, it is a <br>
            state of complete physical, mental and social well-being. <br>
            This means eating a balanced diet, getting regular exercise, <br>
            avoiding tobacco and drugs and getting plenty of rest.</p></div>
